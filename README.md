## Minijava Compiler

It's the course project of Compler Design.

I implement a compiler that transform a Minijava program into Mips code. We can run the Mips code on SPIM simulator and get the correct output. Minijava is a programming language simplified from Java. The implementation of a Minijava compiler consists of 5 components: 
1. Typecheck
2. Minijava to Piglet
3. Piglet to Spiglet
4. Spiglet to Kanga
5. Kanga to Mips
