## Minijava Compiler

It's the course project of Compler Design.

I implement a compiler that transform a Minijava program into Mips code. We can run the Mips code on SPIM simulator and get the correct output. Minijava is a programming language simplified from Java. The implementation of a Minijava compiler consists of 5 components: Typecheck, Minijava to Piglet, Piglet to Spiglet, Spiglet to Kanga, and Kanga to Mips.
